# PIC24F16KL401-TIMER1-Delay
In this contribution is discussed basic utilization of the TIMER1. This periphery represetns a basic 16-bit timer. For the utilization of this module was created the library `tmr_delay`, which is based on the utilization of the capabilities of TIMER1. For more detailed features about this periphery see the Datasheet or the document DS39704 from the Microchip.
* This library provides basic settings and generation of a time delay on the MCU PIC24F16KL401. In the files `tmr_delay.c` and `tmr_delay.h` are placed necessary function which provide settings and the generate a delay. 
* In the main function is an example with utilization of this library. More detailed description you get from the main function and library tmr_delay.
