/* This tutorial shows simple generation of a delay with utiliaztion the Timer 1.
 * After setting a delay, the pin RB4 is toggling and the LED is periodically turned ON and OFF.
 * This toggling causes periodic blinking of the LED on the RB4 GPIO.is periodically turned ON and OFF.

 * The tmr_delay.h library contains two functions for realizing a specific delay.
 * The first function is TMR1DelayUs(uint16_t delay). This function realizes delay from 1 us to 4095 us.
 * The seconf function is TMR1DelayMs(uint16_t delay). This function realizes delay from 1 ms to 262 ms.
